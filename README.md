# Auto Populating Lightbox Gallery
 
Lightbox gallery for displaying images auto-populated on the page using PHP. 


If your web development project needs a nice image gallery lightbox, then this is the project for you!

PHP is used to automatically pull the images from the img folder and to display them on the index page.

Another feature I added using PHP was ordering the images from the img folder by creation date (descending order) via a function. I originally made this project for an artist who wanted their newer illustrations displayed at the very top. That way, no matter what order the images are in looking at the directory POV; the images with the newer creation date always display first. 

The js file handles toggling the lightbox when an image is clicked on, allowing the user to cycle through the images on the index page from within the light box. The lightbox resets to the first image when the user clicks the next arrow on the last image on the page.
